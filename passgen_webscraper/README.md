# Password generator

This is a simple webscraping project that focuses on generating a password that is both readable and strong.
It generates a password based on this pattern:
- (adjective)(noun)(special_character)(number)
Where:
- noun -> Can be a name of a person (e. John), a name of an animal (e. Cat), an object (e. Sofa), or a name of a Yokai (e. Tengubi).
- special_character -> Special keyboard characters such as '@', '&', '%', '$'
